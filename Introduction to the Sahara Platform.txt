Sahara is a Platform for tokenizing property in the protections provided by
traditional ownership of real estate. This Platform is structured around Sahara
Street LLC (“Sahara LLC” or “Sahara”), a series limited liability company.
Sahara LLC is a unique form of limited liability company.

The world's hottest real estate market in Dubai is starting to commercialize
blockchain.
Sahara LLC's goal is a future real estate platform that is safe and easy for anyone to
participate in by applying blockchain technology to current real estate transactions
through a temporary pilot project.

To this end, the Dubai-based MHKhoory Group (www.mhkhoory.com), the
US-based Sahara Street LLC, and the Republic of Malta's LIker World have formed a
consortium.
